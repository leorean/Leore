* GENERAL / CODING STUFF
	- for every logic, check if (global.state == G_PLAY)
	- text can be split in to multiple "pages" via "|" and newlines can be made via "#".
	- doors have "dir" & "targetdir"
		- dir means the direction the player has to face to walk in
		- targetdir is the direction the player is rotated in the new level
	- items
		- "type" = type of the item (necklace, sword, etc..) -> action will be handled in big switch case
		- every item can only be taken once -> the type will be stored in a list and saved
* POWERS / ITEMS:
	- sword
		- no rune, no power
	- MAGICRYSTALS

	- additional player states: 
		- acquire item
		- wake up (for beginning story etc.)
		- die (+ restart from last save statue)
	- HUD
		- HP
		- Magic
	- Magic resource system 
		- slowly recovering?
		- actions / spells cost magic
	- enemies

* STORYLINE:
	- player awakes at the shore - his memory is lost
	- player starts walking north from the southmost point of leore, south beach, where he will find the shrine of shin
	- the entrance to the shrine is blocked, so he will find a cave below instead
	- in the cave, he will find an old relic: Amber Bracelet
	- with its' power, he can enter the shrine of shin, where he will begin to learn his purpose and face his first trial
	- Upon succeeding, he is granted a weapon
	
	
	
---------- Concept revolves around rolling ----------

Objects:
	- Freezer / Unfreezer:
		- freezes the player into a ball and disables controls
		- unfreezes player and enables controls
	- Spring (in every 45°, or better: full 360°)
		- bounces the player off into the direction
	- Speed Tile (4-directional)
		- gives the player full speed in the given direction if he rolls
	- Floor Spring
		- shoots player in the air when z == 0
	- Wind (4 directional)
		- pushes the player in one direction, but rolling can outlast it
	- big Marbles / blocks
		- block the way but can be pushed through rolling
